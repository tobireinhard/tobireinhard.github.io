excerpt: 'In this invited talk, we present the first notion of completeness thresholds for memory safety proofs. They allow us to reduce unbounded memory safety proofs to bounded ones.'

Bounded proofs are convenient to use due to the high degree of automation that exhaustive checking affords. 
However, they fall short of providing the robust assurances offered by unbounded proofs. 
In this invited talk, we sketch how completeness thresholds serve as a bridge, allowing us to derive unbounded guarantees from bounded proofs. 
Using a bubble sort implementation as example, we demonstrate that a bounded proof only needs to consider a few specific inputs to yield unbounded guarantees.

This invited talk was part of an invited research visit of the 
[Programming Group @ HSG, St Gallen](https://programming-group.com)
in Switzerland.

Our research on completeness thresholds for program verification is part of an ongoing project.
