Large-scale distributed applications, e.g., in geodistributed data centers, pose a performance challenge to developers which need to take high cross-data-center latency communication cost into account. We present a preliminary investigation of a type system that tracks latency and makes the cost of remote calls explicit, raising developers’ awareness of communication overhead.
