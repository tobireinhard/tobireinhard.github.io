excerpt: 'Developing efficient geo-distributed applications is challenging as programmers can easily introduce computations that entail high latency communication.
We propose a language design which makes latency explicit and extracts type-level bounds for a computation’s runtime latency.
We present our initial steps with a core calculus that enables extracting provably correct latency bounds and outline future work.'

Developing efficient geo-distributed applications is challenging as programmers can easily introduce computations that entail high latency communication.
We propose a language design which makes latency explicit and extracts type-level bounds for a computation’s runtime latency.
We present our initial steps with a core calculus that enables extracting provably correct latency bounds and outline future work.
