Developing efficient geo-distributed applications is challenging as computations can easily introduce latency without the programmer noticing. We propose a language design which makes latency and locations explicit and extracts static type-level bounds for a computation’s runtime latency. We present a full formalization and prove that all extracted latency bounds are correct. Furthermore, we present a prototype implementation that can be used to assess the usability of the design and the extracted bounds.
