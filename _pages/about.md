I'm a PhD candidate at [DistriNet](https://distrinet.cs.kuleuven.be) since May 2019, supervised by [Bart Jacobs](https://distrinet.cs.kuleuven.be/people/bartj) and [Amin Timany](https://tildeweb.au.dk/au571806/) (Logic and Semantics Group, Aarhus University).
My research interests are program verification, programming languages and type systems in general.
In particular, my research currently focuses on the intertwined topics of verifying _termination of busy-waiting_ and _I/O liveness_:

* *Ghost Signals: Verifying Termination of Busy-Waiting*

* *A Separation Logic to Verify Termination of Busy-Waiting for Abrupt Program Exit*,

Before I joined DistriNet, I obtained my Master's degree from TU Darmstadt.
During my Master's I worked as student research assistant at [Software Technology Group](https://www.stg.tu-darmstadt.de/stg/homepage.en.jsp) on type systems for multitier-languages such as [ScalaLoci](https://scala-loci.github.io).
