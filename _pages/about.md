I'm a PhD candidate at
[DistriNet](https://distrinet.cs.kuleuven.be)
at
[KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/kuleuven/),
working on verification techniques for heap-manipulating programs and supervised by [Bart Jacobs](https://distrinet.cs.kuleuven.be/people/bartj). My overall goal is to simplify program verification. My current research focuses on *completeness thresholds* for memory safety proofs. The goal of this work is to turn bounded memory safety proofs into unbounded ones.
[](
Previously, I developed a separation-logic-based technique
([ghost signals](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-81688-9_2))
to verify liveness properties of concurrent programs.

## Liveness
During my previous research project, I developed a separation logic to verify liveness properties of concurrent programs:

## AWS

In summer 2021, I worked as applied scientist intern with
[Mark Tuttle](https://www.markrtuttle.com/)
in the
[Automated Reasoning Group](https://aws.amazon.com/security/provable-security/)
at
[Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/).
During this internship I explored ways to progress from bounded to unbounded verification.
My research focused on (automatic) memory safety proofs for heap-manipulating programs that involve inductive data structures.
I am happy to return in summer 2022.


## Before my PhD

Before I joined DistriNet, I obtained my Master's degree from
[TU Darmstadt](https://www.tu-darmstadt.de/index.en.jsp).
During my Master's I worked as student research assistant at the
[Software Technology Group](https://www.stg.tu-darmstadt.de/main_stg/index.en.jsp)
on type systems for multitier-languages such as
[ScalaLoci](https://scala-loci.github.io).
