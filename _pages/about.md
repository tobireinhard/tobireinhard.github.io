I'm a PhD candidate at DistriNet since May 2019, supervised by [Bart Jacobs](https://distrinet.cs.kuleuven.be/people/bartj) and [Amin Timany](https://tildeweb.au.dk/au571806/) (Logic and Semantics Group, Aarhus University).
My research interests are program verification, programming languages and type systems in general.
In particular, my research currently focuses on I/O liveness verification and, as a first step towards this, on abrupt termination:

*A Separation Logic to Verify Termination of Busy-Waiting for Abrupt Program Exit*

2. [Technical Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.10215)

Before I joined DistriNet, I obtained my Master's degree from TU Darmstadt.
During my Master's I worked as student research assistant at [Software Technology Group](https://www.stg.tu-darmstadt.de/stg/homepage.en.jsp) on type systems for multitier-languages such as [ScalaLoci](https://scala-loci.github.io).
